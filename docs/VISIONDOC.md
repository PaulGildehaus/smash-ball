## SmashBall
# Product Vision Document

# Summary
SmashBall is a simple game which requires the player to whack a ball through a goal. When the player causes the ball to go through the hoop, the next level of the game is unlocked. Each level has a different set of obstacles, making each one a different puzzle which requires a different strategy to complete.
